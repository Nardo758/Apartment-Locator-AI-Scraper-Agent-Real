Apartment-scraper — Pause note

Date: 2025-09-23

What was done in this session:

- Completed and applied enhanced DB schema migrations (price history, scraping queue, scheduling, triggers, RPCs).
- Added and applied backfill migration to populate scoring fields.
- Implemented and deployed Supabase Functions:
  - `scraper-orchestrator` — picks batches, selects AI model, dispatches jobs, finalizes queue rows, updates metrics.
  - `scraper-worker` — currently a simulated worker returning success/price_changed/duration.
- Ran end-to-end test: inserted a test queue row, invoked orchestrator, observed queue row move to `processing` then `completed` and metrics updated.

Where to resume:

- Replace simulated `scraper-worker` logic with production scraping and AI model calls.
  - Add robust error handling, retries, and persist worker responses to `scraping_queue.data` or a separate `scrape_results` table.
- Improve observability (logs, metrics, errors stored in DB or sent to monitoring).
- Run smoke tests and possibly add unit tests for worker and orchestrator logic.
- Commit and push changes if desired (git is not available in the current terminal environment here).

Local actions you should run before closing this machine or sharing work:

- From the project root (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# Inspect
git status
git --no-pager diff --name-only

# Stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Checkpoint: save workspace before pausing (migrations and functions work)"

# Optional: push
git push origin HEAD
```

Notes:
- The Supabase project used for testing/deploys: jdymvpasjsdbryatscux (function endpoints deployed to this project).
- Environment variables used for local scripts: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env`.

Contact:
- When you're ready, I can replace the simulated worker with production-ready scraping/AI code and prepare a small README and tests.
