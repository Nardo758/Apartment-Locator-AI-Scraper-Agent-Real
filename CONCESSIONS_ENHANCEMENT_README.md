  concessions: string[];
  free_rent_offers: string[];
  base_rent_by_unit: Record<string, number>;
  fees: Record<string, number>;
  // ... existing fields
}
```

### 2. Concession Detector (`enhanced-concession-detector.ts`)
```typescript
export class ConcessionDetector {
  static detectConcessionKeywords(html: string): string[]
  static extractConcessionContext(html: string): any
  static calculateNetEffectiveRent(baseRent: number, freeRentOffer: string): number

    "concessions": ["1 month free rent", "Waived application fee"],
    "free_rent_concessions": "1 month free on 13-month lease",
    "effective_rent": 1385,
    "base_rent": 1500
  },
  "concession_analysis": {
    "concessions_detected": true,
    "quick_scan_results": ["1 month free", "waived fee"],

  }
}
```

### 3. Market Analytics Query
```sql
-- View current concession market summary
SELECT * FROM concession_summary;

-- Get concession metrics for Atlanta market

-- View recent concession analytics
SELECT * FROM concession_analytics 
WHERE market_name = 'atlanta' 
ORDER BY analysis_date DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🎯 Concession Detection Patterns

The system detects various concession types:

### Free Rent Offers
- "1 month free", "6 weeks free"
- "2 months free rent"
- "Free rent until [date]"

### Fee Waivers
- "Waived application fee"
- "No admin fee", "$0 deposit"
- "Reduced security deposit"

### Move-in Specials
- "Move-in special"
- "Limited time offer"
- "New resident promotion"

### Discounts
- "Military discount"
- "Corporate discount"
- "Student special"

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Concession Rate Tracking
Monitor the percentage of properties offering concessions:
```sql
SELECT 
    concession_rate,
    properties_with_concessions,
    total_properties
FROM concession_analytics 
WHERE market_name = 'atlanta'
ORDER BY analysis_date DESC;
```

### 2. Market Pressure Analysis
Identify market conditions:
- **High concession rate (>50%)**: Competitive market, tenant-favorable
- **Medium concession rate (25-50%)**: Balanced market
- **Low concession rate (<25%)**: Landlord-favorable market

### 3. Effective Rent Trends
Track how concessions affect actual rental costs:
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(base_rent) as avg_base_rent,
    AVG(effective_rent) as avg_effective_rent,
    AVG(base_rent - effective_rent) as avg_savings
FROM apartments 
WHERE concessions_applied = true;
```
